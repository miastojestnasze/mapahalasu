This is design of new website to visualise data from noise sensors.

1. data are in server "http://vps-76e4aba0.vps.ovh.net/samples"
2. each sample has 3 attribute "id", "timestamp", and "Lmax"
3. Lmax is value of noise in dB
4. Sensors are located in Warsaw, Poland
5. For each sensor assign random location in Warsaw
6. Show value of latest timestamp per id on a map
7. Point would be circle which area is proportional to noise value.
8. After clicking to point in lower part of the screen I can see line chart 
with data from the last 24 hours.
